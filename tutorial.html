<h1>~Tutorial & Rules~</h1>
</center>
<p>-You are an explorer trying to find long lost treasure hidden miles underground in a dark cave. Rumor has it the treasure is surrounded by deadly traps. You decide to lower yourself from above at fixed coordinates.</p>
<p>-Search a 2D grid until you find the treasure or run out of health points.</p>
<p>-Click a space on the grid to guess where the treasure is hidden.</p>
<p>-"â˜»" marks where you are currently standing on the grid.</p>
<p>-"?" represents unexplored territory. You might find the treasure...or trigger a mine instead!</p>
<p>-"[ ]" represents an empty space. These spaces hold neither treasure nor trap, but they lower the number of spaces you must check in each level.</p>
<p>-"[#]" represents a lantern.  Find one on a space and it will reveal up to 4 neighboring spaces.</p>
<p>-"*" This is a mine. It releases toxic gas when stepped on, killing you slowly. You will lose some HP if you land on a mine.</p>
<p>-[$] the treasure is hidden in a random "?" space. Find it in three levels in a row to beat the game!</p>
<p>-Click 'Quit Game' to stop playing and return to the menu.</p>
